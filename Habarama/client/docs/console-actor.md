# Console

The console actor is more for debugging and is great to test things out without connecting a real hardware to it. This might be removed in a productive state.

## Configuration

This type of actor does not require any additional properties.

    "actors": [
      {
        "name": "Debugging",
        "location": "Wien",
        "type": "console"
      }
    ]

## Hardware

There is no further hardware required. The actions will be loged in the output window.
